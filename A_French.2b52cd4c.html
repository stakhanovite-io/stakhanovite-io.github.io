<h2 id="why-is-the-faq-in-french-only">Why is the FAQ in french only?</h2><p>The Cardano project is already well documented in english and you can find many docs - technical and blog posts - on internet.</p><p>We (operators of STKH) are French. We therefore have a greater interest and incentive to translate and produce short documentation in french.</p><p>That said, <strong>our newsletter is and will always be written in both english and french.</strong></p>
