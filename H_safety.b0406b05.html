<p>Whether you&#39;re a veteran or a newcomer to cryptos, it&#39;s always good to remember a few basic security rules.</p><p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, <strong>the only proof of ownership is the private key.</strong> This private key very often comes in the form of a <strong>suite of secret words (12, 15 or more) also called a mnemonic phrase. This sequence of words is your wallet!</strong></p><h2 id="what-are-the-implications-of-this-principle">What are the implications of this principle?</h2><blockquote>
<h3 id="whoever-gets-their-hands-on-your-private-key-will-have-access-to-your-funds">Whoever gets their hands on your private key will have access to your funds.</h3>
</blockquote><blockquote>
<h3 id="if-you-forget-or-lose-this-private-key-your-digital-assets-will-be-lost-forever">If you forget or lose this private key, your digital assets will be lost forever.</h3>
</blockquote><p>You will therefore do everything to keep your private key(s) safe. In paper format or electronic devices such as Ledger or Trezor, the offer is diversified and you will find the means that suits you best.</p><p><strong>However, remember that one of the greatest dangers is none other than yourself. Never rush into a transaction, especially if it&#39;s the first time.</strong></p><h2 id="points-specific-to-cardano">Points specific to Cardano</h2><p>There is no Daedalus wallet developed for smartphones.
