<h2 id="whats-the-saturation-of-a-pool">What&#39;s the saturation of a pool?</h2><p>Saturation is the <strong>mechanism by which Cardano ensures that a pool cannot grow indefinitely.</strong> Once the saturation point is reached, i.e. a certain amount of delegated ada in a pool, the rewards of that pool will remain the same but they will get divided among more participants... This mechanism therefore provides an incentive to distribute the global stake of the system in an optimal number of pools.</p><p>On the mainnet, the optimal number of pools is currently set at 500. This gives a saturation point of about 64 million ada per pool. </p><p><strong>Be aware of the saturation level of your stake pool! Beyond the saturation point, the rewards per delegate will drop significantly</strong>.</p>
