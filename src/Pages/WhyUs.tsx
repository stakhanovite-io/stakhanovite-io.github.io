            <h3>
            FOR OUR FEES AND RELIABILITY OF COURSE!
            </h3>
            <div>
                The Stakhanovite Stake Pool charges the <strong>minimum authorized fixed costs of 340 ADA per epoch and 1.9% margin fees</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                The profit margin is calculated on the rewards you get thanks to our efforts.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>For example, if your rewards are 10 ADA at the end of an epoch, we get paid 0.19 ADA and the remaining 9.81 ADA are all yours.</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>We are transparent.</strong> From costs to performance, you will know everything and you will always be in a position to make the best choice for you, and your ada!
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>We are efficient.</strong> During the Incentivized Testnet (Shelley ITN), the Stakhanovite Stake Pool created <strong>more than 5000 blocks and distributed above 4 millions ADA to our delegators</strong>, among the top 40 stake pools out there!
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
            DO WE HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME?
            </h3>
            <div>
                Following the Ouroboros protocol, pool operators can make a pledge to their own pool. This will signal to all potential delegators that the owners and operators have indeed skin in the game. 
                <br />
                <br />
                That is why, in addition of our initial pledge of 400 000 ADA, <strong>a good fraction of our rewards will be added to our pool's pledge regularly.</strong>
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>That way, we will grow together!</strong>
