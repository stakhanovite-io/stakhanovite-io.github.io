                Cardano, the blockchain supporting the ada cryptocurrency (ADA), runs in a <strong>proof-of-stake (PoS)</strong> setting. Anyone who owns ada can participate in its functioning. For that however, you must be online at all timesâ€¦
                <br />
                <br />
                Because this last requirement is very demanding and not practical for everyday users, Cardano allows you to delegate your ada (or stake) to a stake pool. 
                <br />
                <br />
                The stake pool <strong>will be online for you</strong> and perform all the necessary validation work on your behalf.
                <br />
                <br />
                <strong>That is exactly why the Stakhanovite Stake Pool is here for you!</strong>
