## Cardano

**The Cardano blockchain is based on a proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.** Unlike other protocols based on proof of work (PoW) (e.g. Bitcoin), **the security of the Cardano ledger is a common good** provided by all ada (Cardano native cryptocurrency) holders.

All ADA holders can take part in the security of the network thanks to **delegation**.
