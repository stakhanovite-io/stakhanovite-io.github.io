## The versions of Daedalus ##

The Daedalus wallet produced by I.O.H.K. currently exists in two distinct versions.
You can install these versions on the same computer, they are independent.

This is the "normal" version of Daedalus. **It connects to mainnet** and allows sending and receiving ada between addresses as well as delegating your ada. 

> [**Daedalus Flight**](https://daedaluswallet.io/en/flight/)

Daedalus Flight is a "beta-test" version of Daedalus that will bring you the latest features. Like Daedalus, **Daedalus Flight connects to mainnet** and allows sending and receiving ada between addresses. **Its black and yellow presentation distinguishes it from Daedalus.** Please note that any transaction carried out on Daedalus Flight will be effective as if you were using Daedalus!
