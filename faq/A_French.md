## Why is the FAQ in french only?

The Cardano project is already well documented in english and you can find many docs - technical and blog posts - on internet.

**We**, the operators of The Stakhanovite Stake Pool, **are French. We therefore have a greater interest and incentive to produce short documentation in french**.

That said, **our newsletter is and will always be written in both FR and EN.**

We hope you won't mind too much!

Cheers,
