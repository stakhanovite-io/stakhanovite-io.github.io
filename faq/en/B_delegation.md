## To keep Cardano safe ##

Anyone with ada can participate in writing the Cardano ledger, in proportion to the quantity of ada held. The more ada you have, the more blocks you will be asked to sign.

**In order to best guarantee the security of Cardano, it is important that an honest majority of ada holders participate in this process.**

As an incentive for ada holders to participate, each signed block entitles you to a reward (in ada). However, the amount of ada to be held for signing blocks **regularly** is important.

## Delegate!

If you don't have several million ada, the wait to sign a block could be very long. Moreover, the computer on which the validator software is running will have to be on and permanently connected to the network, not to miss the opportunity if it ever comes up!

In order to avoid having to wait weeks or months for that opportunity to sign a block, **ada holders can associate by delegating their ada in a stake pool** in order to **sign blocks in a more regularly.**

**A stake pool can therefore be seen as a cooperative** in which the rewards obtained will be shared in proportion to the amount delegated by each. **The stake pool will charge a commission for this service** (see Fees).

## Does it freeze my ada?

**Your ada are never locked**. You are free to spend them as you wish while they are delegated to a pool. 

## Can I lose ada while delegating?

**Your initial amount of ada is not subject to any punitive measures**, even if the stake pool you are delegating to does not do its job as expected.**The worst that can happen to you is not receiving any rewards**. In that case, you would simply have to select another stake pool!
