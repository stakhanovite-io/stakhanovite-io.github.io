**You can now delegate Cardano's mainnet!**

Delegation is done using your favorite wallet app by signing a particular transaction. **This does not require any transfer of ada between addresses. Any request to transfer/send ada for delegating is a scam.**

If you are delegating for the first time, an amount of 2 ADA, in addition to the transaction fees, will be put on deposit. This deposit will be returned when you unregister your staking address.

## Yoroi

[**Yoroi**](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/) (developed by Emurgo): This wallet is a browser extension (Chrome, Firefox or Brave), and is also available for smartphones (iOS and Android). Its interface is very neat and allows you to track your rewards over time.

## Daedalus

[**Daedalus**](https://staking.cardano.org/en/delegation/) (developed by I.O.H.K.): The delegation tab of Daedalus will show you all the stake pools open to delegation. **These stake pools will be ranked from the most interesting (position 1) to the least interesting (position n) over the long term**.

To establish this ranking, **Daedalus takes into account several parameters including the performance of the stake pool over time, its fees, its pledge and its saturation** (see FAQ - Fees, Saturation).

At first glance, it may seem to you that Daedalus offers questionable choices. However, **Daedalus offers a non-myopic ranking**, i.e. **a relevant choice for you in the long term.**

## Which Stake Pool should you choose?

While the stake pool's cost is often considered key in choosing the stake pool, performance is likely to have the greatest impact on your rewards. Also, other criteria, such as community involvement may as well be considered.

For example, if you find this FAQ informative, you may decide to delegate your ada to STKH rather than another equivalent stake pool. By doing so, you are making the **decision to support an ecosystem for what it offers you as a service.**

A second example would be a **charity pool.** Such a stake pool might have high costs for the good reason that it would **reverse its benefits to a good cause**. You'd support a cause that is dear to you in a painless way.

## Is there a perfect strategy?

**Be patient: It takes 3 full epochs after delegation before you ada generate rewards.** Be a little bit patient before declaring your stake pool ineffective!

**"Don't put all your eggs in one basket "** : You can perfectly create several wallets within Daedalus or Yoroi, and delegate each of them independently. Thus, your main wallet will be delegated to stake group A and your second wallet to stake group B, to support a charity, etc...

**Decentralize Cardano**: Avoid letting your favorite exchange delegate your ada on your behalf. It would be tempting to let them do so, especially since they will probably offer you almost zero fees. Only the amount of ada to be exchanged should remain on the exchange. **Otherwise, these players will might accumulate a huge power without actually owning any ada! Take control of your assets!**

## Can I close my wallet after delegation?

Yes, once the delegation transaction has been validated and accepted by the network, you can close your wallet app. That's what delegation is all about: letting a stake pool work for you!
