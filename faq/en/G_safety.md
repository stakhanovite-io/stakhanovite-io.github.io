Whether you're a veteran or a newcomer to cryptos, it's always good to remember a few basic security rules.

In the world of cryptocurrencies, **the only proof of ownership is the private key.** This private key very often comes in the form of a **suite of secret words (12, 15 or more) also called a mnemonic phrase. This sequence of words is your wallet!**

## What are the implications of this principle? ##

>### Whoever gets their hands on your private key will have access to your funds.

>### If you forget or lose this private key, your digital assets will be lost forever.

You will therefore do everything to keep your private key(s) safe. In paper format or electronic devices such as Ledger or Trezor, the offer is diversified and you will find the means that suits you best.

**However, remember that one of the greatest dangers is none other than yourself. Never rush into a transaction, especially if it's the first time.**

## Points specific to Cardano

There is no Daedalus wallet developed for smartphones. The only software available is for windows / mac / linux [here](https://daedaluswallet.io).

If you wish to use a light client please download [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/). It is also available on the Google Playstore or the Appstore for iOS. It is developed by Emurgo. Be extremely careful with fake applications for smartphones and check that the source is **EMURGO**.

The Cardano project and its organisations will never send official announcements to individual users by direct messages. Updates will be posted on official websites and social media.

Never click on links in an unofficial direct message claiming to come from the Cardano Foundation, I.O.H.K., Emurgo or Daedalus.

Do not disclose your assets on the internet, this can make you a target for hackers.

Finally, if you have any suspicions or if you wish to **report a scam**, you can send an e-mail to **report@cardano.org**. As Cardano's official organisation, they can often put extra pressure on third parties to stop the scams.
